CHANGELOG

~~~ 02/28/2026 ~~~
- Added changelog
- Added todo: address edge cases for storage files
- Made the following into functions rather than calling them repeatedly:
    - Printing data
    - Checking user input for empty strings, non-integer-equivalent decimals, and negative numbers. If successful, converts input to integer (if a number), or to title case (if a string).
    - Interpreting error messages from the "check user input" function.
- Created a file to store functions, modified main.py accordingly.
- Added todo: make error messages more obvious.
- Completed todo: Make things into functions because that's clean and nice
