A simple tool to track things.
Enter a new item and the program will add 1 to its count.
Enter the number next to an existing item to do the same.

I'm brand new to all this kind of stuff so sorry if it's terrible! (not really, it's for my own pleasure so say what you will about my terrible coding)

Things to add:
Ability to remove items, or just subtract amount
