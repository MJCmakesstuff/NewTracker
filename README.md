A simple tool to track things.

Enter a new item and the program will add 1 to its count.

Enter the number next to an existing item to do the same.


It's called "NewTracker" because I super messed up the original one


I'm brand new to all this kind of stuff so sorry if it's terrible! (not really, it's for my own pleasure so say what you will about my terrible coding)

\#\#\#

Todo:

Move the data spitter to a better spot cuz it sucks where it is now (use the program you'll see)

Feature: add/sub by number. Like increase this one by 3.

Make things into functions because that's clean and nice

GUI?
